It's not that uncommon nowadays to criticize the widereaching ambition of the
tech sector, what Evgeny Morozov calls "solutionism," that is, the idea that
(often complex social or physical problems) can be solved by the application of
recently developed technologies. Put at its most blunt, the complaint would look
at something like the Gates Foundation and ask what exactly it is about building
a career on buying a knock-off version of CP/M that qualifies Bill Gates in his
ambition to change the entire education sector.

This criticism is all the more potent because most IT innovation is crap. This
may seem an inflamatory way to put it, but how else can you describe an industry
in which only 16% of projects are completed on time and on budget, and where the
remaining 50% of projects which weren't cancelled outright only delivered on
average 60% of the planned features ([Standish Group](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf))?

One widely studied, because so spectacular, IT project failure is the NHS's
National Programme for Information Technology, which was begun in 2002 and 
cancelled in 2011, having cost over Â£10 billion and having pretty much entirely
failed to deliver what was supposed to be its central technological innovation,
a system for unified patient records across the NHS.

One of the main problems with the NPfIT seems to have been that it was conceived
of and practiced as a project to introduce a bunch of technology into the NHS,
without much thought being given to what technology the day-to-day practice of
the NHS (i.e., treating ill people) actually needed ([Clegg & Shepherd](https://lubswww.leeds.ac.uk/fileadmin/webfiles/cstsd/Documents/NPfIT/Clegg_and_Shepherd_JIT07.pdf)). 
We could probably blame Bill Gates for this, too: the project came out of "a 
meeting between the Prime Minister and then CEO of Microsoft, Bill Gates, after 
which the Prime Minister is said to have become 'hooked' on the technological
possibilities for improvement in the NHS" ([Campion-Awwad, Haton, Smith, & Vuaran](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/npfit-mpp-2014-case-history.pdf)).

However, we should be wary of taking, as Clegg and Shepherd do, too rosy a view
of a view of an alternative, sociotechnical approach, which would consider
technology in a social context. Clegg and Shepherd mention one potential advantage 
to the process adopted by the National Programme for IT:

> Because the health service is so big, so complex and so differentiated, it 
> would take forever to get the various end-user communities to lead and agree
> a project of this kind. As such the IT is used as a Trojan horse to force 
> through some changes in working practices and processes.

What they don't mention is the *kind* of changes in working practices and 
processes that coincided with the National Programme for IT. The changes to
the NHS introduced by the New Labour government were specifically neoliberal
ones, that is, changes based around an intensification of the internal market
mechanisms introduced by the previous Conservative government, organised 
around competition, measurement of outcomes, and deprofessionalisation of 
the roles of health care workers.

The point I want to make by bringing this up is that the changes in the
organisation of the health service that a properly implemented NHS IT 
programme could enable would be the result of particular and contestible 
political choices: they would have been the materialisation of the political
victory of neoliberalism over alternative ways of understanding the role of
government.

Clegg and Shepherd present their sociotechnical alternative to the 
techocentric approach in quite fluffy terms, talking about processes that are
"owned and led by senior end-users," (though note they limit this to *senior* 
end-users; I'll have more to say about this in a future post), who introduce 
"new working practices" as part of a "National Programme for Service 
Delivery." But if they simply accept a particular conception of "service
delivery" as given, their IT projects will contineu to be a "trojan horse" for
political projects they don't consider.

It seems to me that the study of information systems needs to pay attention to 
an insight from critical theory: that the social is always organised according 
to power relations, and so any sociotechnical approach is also a 
politicotechnical approach. It might be, as in the sociotechnical approach 
outlined by Clegg and Shepherd, a politicotechnical approach that is simply 
silent about, and so accepts, existing political relations. But I think there
is, or should be, space for what we might call a critical information systems,
that attempts to be self-aware about the political choices that are embodied
in the information systems we are building.
