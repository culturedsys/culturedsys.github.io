It's hard to escape the feeling, reading the Gang of Four *Design Patterns*
book, that there are slightly too many design patterns. Many of the patterns
seem to have similarities and homologies, leading to the suspicion that with
just a little more abstraction some of the patterns could be combined. After
thinking about this for a while, though, I'm not sure this objection is right;
at any rate, considering why it might not be helpful to abstract away
differences between patterns has clarified some stuff for me about the point
of design patterns.
